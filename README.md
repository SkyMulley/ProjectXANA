ProjectXANA is an addon to ProjectCarthage that aims to pick up GamePlay wise where ProjectCarthage hasn't, which, if you haven't read the title, is building onto the XANA AI.
Currently ProjectXANA is in Beta, only achieving attacks when a tower is activated using ProjectCarthage and with only a few attacks included, which at this point is:
- LaughingGas
- NuclearPlant

Feel free to support ProjectXANA's development by forking and developing further. This plugin is mainly to be used on the MRCL (Minecraft Replica of Code Lyoko) Server, so you can check it out there.
The code and project is open source and can be used and edited by anyone and everyone. Of course it requires Project Carthage to run (Spigot 1.12)
REMINDER: This is an addon to ProjectCarthage, PRC does not have any requirements for PRX of any kind and never will.
